        <p>In today's life, very few people give proper attention to correct posture. Everyone is used to sitting long hours in front of the computer, either to play games or to study. So what happens to your back ? It becomes stiff. It becomes rigid. There is poor circulation of blood in your body. Your shoulders become hard and stiff like a tree, so much that people might think that you have become a caveman. </p>

      <p>How do you solve this problem ? How can you play games for several hours without harming your body ? Once again, as scientists, we turn to our ancient treasures of knowledge to find the answers to our problems. Luckily for us, even though there was no Google 2000+ years ago, even though there was no Internet, the solution to all our problems has been carefully passed on from generation to generation by means of Yoga. </p>

      <p>The world of Yoga is as vast as the World of Warcraft and ever bigger, better and more awesome than the levels of Temple Run. It will even crush the Candy Crush! So, today we will learn about a very simple asana (which means seat) called Sarvangasanaâ€”sarva means everything and anga means limbs. Therefore, this means that the posture that is good for every aspect and every limb of the human being by stimulating and rejuvenating your entire body. </p>

        <code><em>Asana</em>: Seat</code>

        <p> Some common English names for this asana: </p>
        <code><em>Shoulder stand</em></code>
        <code><em>Inverted stand</em></code>

      <section id="benefits" class="main-section">
        <header>Benefits</header>
        <p>        In this asana, you build up both power and a new structure in your back and you bring relaxation to well-known stress areas like the neck and the lower back. The muscles of your lower back get stronger, the chest and shoulders can move more freely and the back gets straighter. It also stimulates the thyroid gland and is good for blood circulation in the chest, shoulders, upper back and the neck. </p>

        <p>This asana stretches the heart muscles by returning more venous blood to the heart, thereby helping people with low blood pressure. This also brings relief to people with varicose veins due to being upside down and hence, easing the flow of blood back to the heart. </p>

        <p>In addition, it strengthens the neck muscles and brings a rich supply of blood to the brain. As a preliminary pose to Shirshasana, it accustoms the brain to the increased influx of blood and for the crown to support the weight of the body.</p>

        <p>The inverted posture also stimulates the thyroid and parathyroid glands and normalizes their functionsand at the same time tones the legs and abdominal muscles.  It also reduces fatigue and alleviates insomnia. It is also considered to be therapeutic for asthma and sinusitis. </p>
