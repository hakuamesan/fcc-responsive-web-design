    <h1> How do you define Yoga?</h1>
    <p>Yoga, as described in the classical text <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga_Sutras_of_Patanjali" target="_blank">
        'Yoga Sutra' by Patanjali</a>, is a way of calming the mental agitation
      so that you can let your true self emerge. </p>

    <p> This can be achieved in 8 easy steps, namely:
      <details>
        <summary>Step 1: Yam        </summary>
        <p> The first step, yama, deals with one's ethical standards and sense of integrity, focusing on our behavior 
          and how we conduct ourselves in life. There are 5 yama's - Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truthfulness), 
          Asteya (non-stealing), Brahmacharya (not sexual), Aparigraha (non-covetousness). </p>
      </details>

      <details>
        <summary>Step 2: Niyam      </summary>
        <p> The second step has to do with self-discipline and spiritual observances. There are 5 niyama's - Saucha (cleanliness),
          Santosha (happiness/contend), Tapas (intensity/passion), Svadhyaya (Self-study), Ishvara pranidhana (surrender to God). </p>       
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Step 3: Asana      </summary>
        <p> This is the most popular step that almost everyone knows about and learns in typical Yoga classes. </p>       
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Step 4: Pranayama  </summary>
        <p> Prana (life force) and yama (restriction) brings about a control over your mind by restricting or controlling
        your breathing. The ancient yogi's found a direct relation between your breathing and your state of mind. </p>       
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Step 5: Pratyahara </summary>
        <p> Withdrawal of your senses from the external stimuli. </p>       
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Step 6: Dharana    </summary>
        <p> Further refinements to the previous steps of Pranayama and Pratyahara by controlling the distractions to your mind.</p>       
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Step 7: Dhyana     </summary>
        <p> Also known as Meditation.  </p>       
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Step 8: Samadhi    </summary>
        <p> Enlightenment. </p>
